Title: rbrothers: multiple change-point recombination detection
Author: Vladimir Minin, Jan Irvahn
Maintainer: Jan Irvahn <ji26@uw.edu>
Description: rbrothers is a phylogenetic recombination detection package. Starting with aligned DNA sequences, rbrothers uses the Bayesian multiple change-point model implemented in the JAVA package DualBrothers to create posterior tree probability plots. rbrothers automates the production of a reasonable set of candidate trees and provides trace plots and autocorrelation plots that allow the user to monitor the convergence and mixing of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
